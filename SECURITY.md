# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

<!-- Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates. -->

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| > 0.3   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.3   | :x:                |

Whilst in pre-release the supported versions is just a very rough guide.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. -->

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->
- The best way to report a vulnerability is through the `issues` tab on GitHub but note that since this is a personal project for me (@wolffshots) so resolution of security issues may take some time.
- The alternative is to just fork the repo, make a patch and create a PR and I'll review and merge.
