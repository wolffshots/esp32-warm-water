# Contributing

Feel free to use and modify the code however you want (it is all licensed under MIT so you just need to include that license for the code).

If you think you can make an improvement then please fork, make the change and create a PR because I'd love to have contributions. 
If you have an idea for an improvement but are not sure that you can make the change yourself then create an issue or discussion and hopefully we can sort something out :)
